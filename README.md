# Lucid Dreaming Protocol

A comprehensive, science-based guide to lucid dreaming with practical tools and techniques.

## üåô What's Inside

**[Main Protocol](https://ra13s.github.io/lucid-dreaming-guide/)** - Complete lucid dreaming training program
- Weekly workout schedule with progression milestones
- Evidence-based techniques (WBTB+MILD, SSILD, DEILD, TLR)
- Dream journaling guidelines and reality check training
- In-dream stabilization and control techniques

**[TLR Audio Generator](https://ra13s.github.io/lucid-dreaming-guide/tlr-generator.html)** - Create targeted lucidity rehearsal audio
- Northwestern University protocol implementation
- Custom cue generation with precise timing
- Raw audio downloads for your own apps
- Multiple sound options and formats

**[Supplement Guide](https://ra13s.github.io/lucid-dreaming-guide/supplements.html)** - Pharmacologically-optimized stacks
- Evidence-based supplement protocols ranked by effectiveness
- Safety guidelines and dosage recommendations
- Mechanistic explanations and research citations

## üî¨ Science-Based Approach

All techniques are backed by peer-reviewed research:
- Northwestern University TLR studies (3√ó effectiveness)
- Erlacher & Stumbrys sleep lab WBTB validation
- University of Adelaide B6 dream recall research
- Meta-analysis of meditation and lucidity correlations

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Week 1-2**: Master basic dream recall and MILD technique
2. **Week 3-4**: Add TLR audio training for consistent practice
3. **Week 5+**: Integrate advanced techniques and troubleshoot
4. **Month 3+**: Consider supplement protocols if needed

## üì± Tools Included

- **TLR Generator**: Create research-validated audio cues
- **Reality Check Tracker**: Build consistent daily habits
- **Dream Journal Templates**: Optimize recall and pattern recognition
- **Weekly Schedule**: Structured progression with rest periods

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Techniques are more important than supplements
- Consistency beats intensity - follow the 2√ó/week WBTB limit
- Take regular breaks to prevent burnout
- Individual results vary - be patient with the process

## üìö For Researchers

All claims are cited with peer-reviewed sources. The protocol is designed around established sleep science and validated lucid dreaming research. See the references section in each guide for complete citations.
